## Sumo minigame

As assignment from a OOP class, some years ago, I made this game, inspired in a minigame from a Rockstar game, Bully.

*It's ugly, but it works.* 

I'm a C/C++ programmer mainly, but I rushed to python to deliver it until deadline - I think this is a great proof that python is a great language to test/prototype ideas. It took 3 hours, from zero to this point. 

## How to play it

To run it:

    pip install pygame
    python sumo.py


To play it:

> Esc to exit. Arrow keys to move.
> Eat healthy food. Avoid fighters and rotten stuff.

I did it so fast and furiously that I didn't set an end or goal to it. If you want to do it, feel free to.
